                        In a modern-day England where two warring factions 
                        of witches live amongst humans, seventeen-year-old 
                        Nathan is an abomination, the illegitimate son of 
                        the world's most powerful and violent witch. Nathan 
                        is hunted from all sides: nowhere is safe and no one 
                        can be trusted. Now, Nathan has come into his own 
                        unique magical Gift, and he's on the run--but the 
                        Hunters are close behind, and they will stop at nothing 
                        ntil they have captured Nathan and destroyed his father.

                        One day fourteen-year-old Sophie Amundsen comes home 
                        from school to find in her mailbox two notes, with one
                        question on each: "Who are you?" and "Where does the
                        world come from?" From that irresistible beginning, 
                        Sophie becomes obsessed with questions that take her 
                        far beyond what she knows of her Norwegian village. 
                        Through those letters, she enrolls in a kind of 
                        correspondence course, covering Socrates to Sartre, 
                        with a mysterious philosopher, while receiving letters 
                        addressed to another girl. Who is Hilde? And why does 
                        her mail keep turning up? To unravel this riddle, Sophie 
                        must use the philosophy she is learning—but the truth 
                        turns out to be far more complicated than she could have 
                        imagined.

                        The Selection began with thirty-five girls.
                        Now with the group narrowed down to the six Elite, the competition to win 
                        Prince Maxon's heart is fiercer than ever—and America is still 
                        struggling to decide where her heart truly lies. Is it with Maxon,
                         who could make her life a fairy tale? Or with her first love, Aspen?

                        America is desperate for more time. But the rest of the Elite know 
                        exactly what they want—and America's chance to choose is about to slip away.
